It's over for you
You finished what you came here to do
It won't be so long
Until you wave goodbye to us

Wake up and sigh
A tired and slow, achy rise
A thought from the previous night
A walk in the morning, alone

You've stood here before
A picture in the back of your mind
A fever in your tingling nerves
Dissolving with all that you were

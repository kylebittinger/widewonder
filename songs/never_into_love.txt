Never follow a light in the fog
I won't be waiting for it night after night
Idle whispers in my thoughts are fine
Tired of thinking ever through all the time

  Not into love
Never into love
Never into love
Never into love

Having patience in two folded arms
Wistful feeling I left in the night
Pleasant company out for a time
I'm protected but I'm not feeling right

  Not into love
Never into love
Never into love
Never into love

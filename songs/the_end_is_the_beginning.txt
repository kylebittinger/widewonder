Heaven fell for us
The end is the beginning
Forever wondrous
Meeting at the end

When we were careless in the open air
Beyond the edge of town
Unstained and oblivious
To heaven crashing over us

The pieces of heaven
Are falling over us
The last words of heaven 
Forever missing on the way to love

Many others felt
The thunderclap of happiness
We had to journey back
To whisper the words of love we missed

When we stumble over
Faults of fickle love
Will we put it all
To rest as if we had never known
(Forgetting all we know)

The last words are never
Returning to trouble us
The hour when I leave you
Is just like the time when we first met
